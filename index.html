                                In my spare time, I enjoy creating digital art on my laptop. I use a touchscreen-compatible pen
                                and paint on my laptop's screen like a canvas!

                                    I enjoy lots of different parts of the natural world. I like learning new things about nature, including
                                    its plants, animals, and geography! At the moment, I'm really interested in spiders. Click the image

                                I also enjoy playing various games of all varieties! I mostly play video games made by indie developers,
                                but I also play board games and tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), such as Dungeons & Dragons!
