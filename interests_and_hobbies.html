                <h2>Art</h2>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy creating digital art on my laptop. I use a touchscreen-compatible pen
                    to use my laptop's screen as a canvas!
                </p>

                <h2>Nature</h2>
                <p>I enjoy lots of different parts of the natural world. I like learning new things about nature, including
                    its plants, animals, and geography!
                </p>
                <p>At the moment, I'm really interested in spiders. Click the image below to learn about one of my favorite ones!</p>

                <h2>Games</h2>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy playing various games of all varieties! I mostly play video games made by indie developers,
                    but I also play board games and tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), such as Dungeons & Dragons!
